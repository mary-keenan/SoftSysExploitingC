# Exploiting C
By Mary Keenan

## Goals
The goal of this project is to collect examples of vulnerable C programs, identify their vulnerabilities, and exploit them. My MVP will be completing projects 1-4 in the City College class (described in the Resources section) as they are supposed to be completed in the first month of the class, so it seems doable that I could complete them in the time frame of this project. My stretch goal is to complete more of the projects in the City College class and also to complete Project 1 in Purdue’s Information Security class (described in the Resources section) which has significantly less guidance. If this all proves to be too easy, I can also attempt [Project 1 in the Stanford Computer Security course](https://crypto.stanford.edu/cs155old/cs155-spring10/hw_and_proj/pp1/proj1.pdf). 

## Learning Goals
My learning goal is to learn about common security vulnerabilities in C programs (ie buffer overflow) and how to exploit them.

## Resources
There are two classes with online resources I plan to use: [City College of SF’s Exploit Development course](https://samsclass.info/127/127_S17.shtml) and [Purdue’s Information Security course](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/clg/CS526/). I’ll use the lectures and reading materials from both classes as well as complete small projects in the City College class to learn about cyber security. Once I have a decent grasp of the common vulnerabilities and exploits, I am tentatively planning to do as much of [Project 1 in the Purdue class](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/clg/CS526/projects/project1.pdf) as I can, but I’m unsure as of right now if I’ll know enough to be able to exploit the practice programs with the limited guidance provided. Other resources I plan to use include a [former SoftSys project](https://github.com/SelinaWang/SoftSysSiz) and a number of blog posts by Dhaval Kapil (https://dhavalkapil.com/blogs/Buffer-Overflow-Exploit/, https://dhavalkapil.com/blogs/Shellcode-Injection/, and https://dhavalkapil.com/blogs/FILE-Structure-Exploitation/) as well as the book he wrote called [Heap Exploitation](https://heap-exploitation.dhavalkapil.com/attacks/).
