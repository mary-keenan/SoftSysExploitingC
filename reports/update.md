# Exploiting C
By Mary Keenan

## Goals
The goal of this project is to collect examples of vulnerable C programs, identify their vulnerabilities, and exploit them. My MVP will be completing projects 0-4 in the City College class (described in the Resources section) as they are supposed to be completed in the first month of the class, so it seems doable that I could complete them in the time frame of this project. My stretch goal is to complete more of the projects in the City College class and also to complete Project 1 in Purdue’s Information Security class (described in the Resources section) which has significantly less guidance. If this all proves to be too easy, I can also attempt [Project 1 in the Stanford Computer Security course](https://crypto.stanford.edu/cs155old/cs155-spring10/hw_and_proj/pp1/proj1.pdf). 

## Learning Goals
My learning goal is to learn about common security vulnerabilities in C programs (ie buffer overflows) and how to exploit them. Exploiting means taking control of an operating system or influencing it in some way. For example, if some victim code has an input field with no bounds checking, an attacker could input a string that exceeds the field's buffer size (insert "abcdefghij" into array[5]), which would lead to a buffer overflow. This would allow the attacker to overwrite the return address of the input function to point to shellcode, which launches a command shell the attacker can use to control the system running the victim code. I want to learn more about identifying vulnerabilities and choosing the right form of attack. 

## Progress
I have been doing coursework from both the City College and Purdue classes. I've watched the first and second lectures for the City College course,
completed readings for four of the six topics I plan to cover in the Purdue class, installed a 32-bit Kali Linux VM for testing, and completed the first two projects in the City College class. So far, I think I've learned a lot. The two classes are great resources and I think I've scoped this project well. I expect I'll be able to achieve my MVP of completing the first five City College projects without much trouble as I've already completed two, and I have a lot of options for stretch goals (more City College projects + lectures as well as more Purdue readings + projects). More information on the resources I'm using are below.

### Additional Information on Resources
There are two classes with online resources I am using: [City College of SF’s Exploit Development course](https://samsclass.info/127/127_S17.shtml) and [Purdue’s Information Security course](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/clg/CS526/). I’m consuming the early lectures and reading materials from both classes as well as completing small projects in the City College class to learn about cyber security. Once I have a decent grasp of the common vulnerabilities and exploits, I am tentatively planning to do as much of [Project 1 in the Purdue class](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/clg/CS526/projects/project1.pdf) as I can, but I’m unsure as of right now if I’ll know enough to be able to exploit the practice programs with the limited guidance provided. Other resources I have available include a [former SoftSys project](https://github.com/SelinaWang/SoftSysSiz) and a number of blog posts by Dhaval Kapil (https://dhavalkapil.com/blogs/Buffer-Overflow-Exploit/, https://dhavalkapil.com/blogs/Shellcode-Injection/, and https://dhavalkapil.com/blogs/FILE-Structure-Exploitation/) as well as the book he wrote called [Heap Exploitation](https://heap-exploitation.dhavalkapil.com/attacks/). 

## Next Steps
Right now, I'm continuing to work through projects and lectures in the City College course, as well as completing readings for the Purdue class. There are three concrete tasks I'm addressing next:

1. Watch the third lecture in the City College course.
   - **Deliverable**: Notes pushed to the repository.
2. Do project two in the City College course.
   - **Deliverable**: Code pushed to the repository.
3. Read "How to 0wn the Internet in Your Spare Time" for the Purdue course.
   - **Deliverable**: Notes pushed to the repository.
