# Exploiting C
By Mary Keenan

## Goals
The goal of this project is to collect examples of vulnerable C programs, identify their vulnerabilities, and exploit them. My MVP will be completing projects 1-4 in the City College class (described in the Resources section) as they are supposed to be completed in the first month of the class, so it seems doable that I could complete them in the time frame of this project. My stretch goal is to complete more of the projects in the City College class and also to complete Project 1 in Purdue’s Information Security class (described in the Resources section) which has significantly less guidance. If this all proves to be too easy, I can also attempt [Project 1 in the Stanford Computer Security course](https://crypto.stanford.edu/cs155old/cs155-spring10/hw_and_proj/pp1/proj1.pdf). 

## Learning Goals
My learning goal is to learn about common security vulnerabilities in C programs (ie buffer overflow) and how to exploit them.

## Progress
I have been doing coursework from both the City College and Purdue classes. I've watched the first and second lectures for City College,
completed readings for four of the six topics I plan to cover in the Purdue class, installed a 32-bit Kali Linux VM for testing, and completed the first two projects in the City College class. So far, I think I've learned a lot. The two classes are great resources and I think I've scoped this project well. I expect I'll be able to achieve my MVP without much trouble, and I have a lot of options for stretch goals (more City College projects + lectures and more Purdue readings + projects). More information on the resources I'm using are below.

### Additional Information on Resources
There are two classes with online resources I am using: [City College of SF’s Exploit Development course](https://samsclass.info/127/127_S17.shtml) and [Purdue’s Information Security course](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/clg/CS526/). I’m consuming the lectures and reading materials from both classes as well as completing small projects in the City College class to learn about cyber security. Once I have a decent grasp of the common vulnerabilities and exploits, I am tentatively planning to do as much of [Project 1 in the Purdue class](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/clg/CS526/projects/project1.pdf) as I can, but I’m unsure as of right now if I’ll know enough to be able to exploit the practice programs with the limited guidance provided. Other resources I plan to use include a [former SoftSys project](https://github.com/SelinaWang/SoftSysSiz) and a number of blog posts by Dhaval Kapil (https://dhavalkapil.com/blogs/Buffer-Overflow-Exploit/, https://dhavalkapil.com/blogs/Shellcode-Injection/, and https://dhavalkapil.com/blogs/FILE-Structure-Exploitation/) as well as the book he wrote called [Heap Exploitation](https://heap-exploitation.dhavalkapil.com/attacks/). 

## Next Steps
Right now, I'm continuing to work through projects and lectures in the City College course, as well as completing readings for the Purdue class. There are three concrete tasks I'm addressing next:

1. Watch the third lecture in the City College course
   - **Deliverable**: Notes pushed to the repository
2. Do the second project in the City College course
   - **Deliverable**: Code pushed to the repository
3. Read "How to 0wn the Internet in Your Spare Time" for the Purdue course
   - **Deliverable**: Notes pushed to the repository
