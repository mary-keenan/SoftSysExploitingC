## Understanding System Calls
- Shellcode typically spawns a root shell (which gives open access to a system), but it can do other things as well.
- Syscalls directly access the kernel, something that processes in user mode cannot do; exit(0) is an example of a syscall.
- There are four **protection rings** that can be used to protect the kernel; however, only rings 0 (kernel-land) and 3 (user-land) are actually used by Windows and Unix. 
- Access exceptions are generated when programs in user-mode try to access kernel memory; user-mode programs can only access kernel memory through syscalls.
- INT 0x80 is assembly code for syscalls.
- Shellcode has to be very compact since most vulnerabilities only allow a small number of bytes to be injected; as a result, it's very primitive and prone to crashing. Exploitations don't need to be reliable; they just need to work. Error-handling just takes up extra space.
- Metasploit (a penetration testing software) can easily write shellcode for any machine or purpose, but it's important to understand the basics of shellcode, and bad (null) characters.
- As of 2017, anti-virus software only catches about 3% of viruses, but it is itself riddled with security flaws, so some people say it hurts users more than it helps. The most important security measure is to update whenever updates are available.
