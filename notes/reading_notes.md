# Notes from the Purdue Readings
The list of readings can be found [here](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/clg/CS526/). All of the readings are in the purdue_readings/ folder in this repository.

## Introduction, Threat Modeling
All three readings are very short. The first one has an interesting punchline, but it takes some time to get there. The second article is a little funny, but the third was not particularly useful.

### Reflections on Trusting Trust
- The C compiler is written in C...magic.
- The moral is that you can't trust code you did not write. The author demonstrated how he could create a bug in the C compiler that would allow him to login as any user in a program compiled with his bugged compiler -- without leaving any trace in the source code.
- The lower the program level, the harder it is to detect bugs.
- The author is advocating that breaking into computer systems should have the same penalties as analogous crimes, like breaking into a building, but he believes there's a cultural gap where people don't yet see them as analogous cases.

### The Security Mindset
- Security professionals can't help but constantly look for vulnerabilities and ways to exploit them.
- It's harder to teach someone to think a certain way than it is to teach them content (although there are professors trying), but it's useful for everyone to think with a security mindset.

### How to Think Like a Security Professional
- Security knowledge may go out-of-date, but the mindset won't.
