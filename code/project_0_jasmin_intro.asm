; each section below is intended to be run from scratch since they play around with memory,
; so you should comment out sections preceding whatever code you wish to run (using a ;) to make sure memory is clean


; storing results in memory
mov eax, 4
mov ebx, 6
mov [eax], ebx
mov ecx, eax
add ecx, ebx
mov [eax+4], ecx


; using the stack
mov eax, 4
mov ebx, 6
push eax
push ebx
pop ecx

; reversing a sequence
mov eax, 1
mov ebx, 2
mov ecx, 3
mov edx, 4
push eax
push ebx
push ecx
push edx
pop eax
pop ebx
pop ecx
pop edx
